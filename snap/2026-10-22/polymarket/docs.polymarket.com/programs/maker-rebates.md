# Maker Rebates Program

> Earn daily pUSD rebates by providing liquidity on Polymarket

Polymarket charges taker fees across multiple market categories. Fees are determined by the protocol at match time and fund a **Maker Rebates** program that pays daily pUSD rebates to liquidity providers.

***

## Why Maker Rebates

Deeper liquidity means tighter spreads, lower price impact, more reliable fills, and greater resilience during volatility. Maker Rebates incentivize **consistent, competitive quoting** so everyone gets a better trading experience.

***

## How Maker Rebates Work

* **Paid daily in pUSD:** Rebates are calculated and distributed every day.
* **Performance-based:** You earn based on the share of liquidity you provided that actually got taken.

### Eligibility

Place orders that add liquidity to the book and get filled (i.e., your liquidity is taken by another trader).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Maker rebates are funded by taker fees, so fills on markets with a 0% taker fee (including markets temporarily made fee-free during a fee holiday) earn **no maker rebate** for as long as the fee is 0.

### Payment

Rebates are paid daily in pUSD, directly to your wallet. A minimum accrued rebate of **\$1 pUSD** is required for a payout.

***

## Read Your Rebated Fees

Read a maker's rebate amounts for a calendar day to reconcile the program with
your accounting.

**TypeScript**

Call `fetchCurrentRebates()` using an existing `PublicClient` named `client`.
If needed, [create a public client](/getting-started/typescript.md#create-a-public-client).
The method is also available on `SecureClient`.

```ts theme={null}
const rebates = await client.fetchCurrentRebates({
  date: "2026-10-06",
  makerAddress: "0xFeA4cB3dD4ca7CefD3368653B7D6FF9BcDFca604",
});

for (const rebate of rebates) {
  console.log(rebate.conditionId, rebate.rebatedFeesUsdc);
}
```

Each `RebatedFee` includes `date`, `conditionId`, `assetAddress`,
`makerAddress`, and `rebatedFeesUsdc`. The amount is an exact USDC decimal string.
Keep it as a string or use a decimal library for accounting. The method returns
an empty array when the maker has no rebates for the requested date.

**Python**

Call `get_current_rebates()` using an existing `AsyncPublicClient` named `client`.
If needed, [create a public client](/getting-started/python.md#create-a-public-client).
The method is also available on `AsyncSecureClient`. The synchronous clients
provide the same method.

```python theme={null}
rebates = await client.get_current_rebates(
    date="2026-10-06",
    maker_address="0xFeA4cB3dD4ca7CefD3368653B7D6FF9BcDFca604",
)

for rebate in rebates:
    print(rebate.condition_id, rebate.rebated_fees_usdc)
```

Each `RebatedFee` includes `date`, `condition_id`, `asset_address`,
`maker_address`, and `rebated_fees_usdc`. The date is a `datetime.date` and the
USDC amount is a `Decimal`. The method returns an empty tuple when the maker
has no rebates for the requested date.

**API**

Request a date and the nonzero maker address without authentication.

```bash theme={null}
curl -G "https://clob.polymarket.com/rebates/current" \
  --data-urlencode "date=2026-10-06" \
  --data-urlencode "maker_address=0xFeA4cB3dD4ca7CefD3368653B7D6FF9BcDFca604"
```

Illustrative response:

> **Output: Maker Rebates**
>
> ```json theme={null}
> [
>   {
>     "date": "2026-10-06",
>     "condition_id": "0x747dc809fb79e1b05be09c42d6179459a58de2ef3e40f02484a4e1260f741f75",
>     "asset_address": "0x9c4E1703476E875070EE25b56A58B008CFb8FA78",
>     "maker_address": "0xFeA4cB3dD4ca7CefD3368653B7D6FF9BcDFca604",
>     "rebated_fees_usdc": "1.599840"
>   }
> ]
> ```

For a maker with no rows, the response is:

```json theme={null}
null
```

The response is an array when rebates exist, or `null` when there are no rows.
Each entry contains `date`, `condition_id`,
`asset_address`, `maker_address`, and `rebated_fees_usdc`, an exact USDC decimal
string. This read is not paginated.

Use a valid `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar date and the maker's nonzero EVM address.
The requested date is not restricted to today.

## Funding

Maker Rebates are funded by taker fees collected in eligible markets. A percentage of these fees are redistributed to makers who keep the markets liquid. The rebate percentage differs by market type.

| Category | Maker Rebate | Distribution Method |
| - | - | - |
| Crypto | 20% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Sports | 15% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Finance | 25% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Politics | 25% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Economics | 25% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Culture | 25% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Weather | 25% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Other / General | 25% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Mentions | 25% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Tech | 25% | Fee-curve weighted |
| Geopolitics | — | Fee-free |

> [!NOTE]
>
> Polymarket collects taker fees in eligible markets across all fee-enabled categories.
> The rebate percentage is at the sole discretion of Polymarket
> and may change over time.

***

## Fee-Curve Weighted Rebates

Rebates are distributed using the **same formula as taker fees**. This ensures makers are rewarded proportionally to the fee value their liquidity generates.

For each filled maker order:

```text theme={null}
fee_equivalent = C × feeRate × p × (1 - p)
```

Where **C** = number of shares traded and **p** = price of the shares. The fee parameters differ by market type:

| Category | Taker Fee Rate | Maker Fee Rate |
| - | - | - |
| Crypto | 0.07 | 0 |
| Sports | 0.05 | 0 |
| Finance | 0.04 | 0 |
| Politics | 0.04 | 0 |
| Economics | 0.05 | 0 |
| Culture | 0.05 | 0 |
| Weather | 0.05 | 0 |
| Other / General | 0.05 | 0 |
| Mentions | 0.04 | 0 |
| Tech | 0.04 | 0 |
| Geopolitics | 0 | 0 |

Your daily rebate:

```text theme={null}
rebate = (your_fee_equivalent / total_fee_equivalent) * rebate_pool
```

Totals are calculated per market, so you only compete with other makers in the same market.

***

## Taker Fee Structure

Taker fees are calculated in pUSD and vary based on the share price. The fee amount in pUSD is symmetric around 50% probability — a trade at 30¢ incurs the same dollar fee as a trade at 70¢.

### Fee Tables (100 Shares)

For detailed fee tables for each market category, see the [Fees](/trading/fees.md) page.

### Fee Precision

Fees are rounded to 5 decimal places. The smallest fee charged is 0.00001 pUSD. Anything smaller rounds to zero, so very small trades near the extremes may incur no fee at all.
