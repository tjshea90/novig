}
```

***

orders but cannot place new orders.

**503** `Service Unavailable`

is in post-only mode. You can cancel orders and place orders with `postOnly:
    true`; non-post-only orders are rejected. The response includes `code:
    "post_only_mode"` and `retry_after_seconds`, and the same retry delay is also
sent in the `Retry-After` HTTP header.

Example response:

```json theme={null}
{
  "error": "post-only mode: only post-only orders and cancels are allowed",
  "code": "post_only_mode",
  "retry_after_seconds": 79

### POST orders

All errors from `POST /order` apply, plus:

**400** `Bad Request`

`Too many orders in payload: {N}, max allowed: {M}` — The batch contains more
orders than the maximum allowed per request.

Per-order errors are returned in the `200` response array, with individual error messages for each failed order.

In post-only mode, non-post-only orders in a batch return per-order errors:

```json theme={null}
[
  {
    "errorMsg": "post-only mode: only post-only orders and cancels are allowed",
    "orderID": "",
    "takingAmount": "",
    "makingAmount": "",
    "status": "",
    "success": true
  },
  {
    "errorMsg": "post-only mode: only post-only orders and cancels are allowed",
    "orderID": "",
    "takingAmount": "",
    "makingAmount": "",
    "status": "",
    "success": true

## Order Processing Errors

These errors are returned when an order passes initial validation but fails during processing. They appear in the response body of `POST /order` and `POST /orders`.

**400** `Bad Request`

`invalid post-only order: order crosses book` — A post-only (maker) order
would immediately match. Adjust the price so it rests on the book.

**400** `Bad Request`

`order {id} is invalid. Price ({price}) breaks minimum tick size rule: {tick}`
— The order price doesn't align with the market's tick size. Use [`GET
    /tick-size`](/api-reference/market-data/get-tick-size.md) to check the valid tick
size.

**400** `Bad Request`

`order {id} is invalid. Size ({size}) lower than the minimum: {min}` — The

`not enough balance / allowance` — Insufficient pUSD balance or token
allowance. Make sure the account holds enough pUSD and grant the trading
approvals with [Set Up Trading
Approvals](/trading/wallets-auth.md#set-up-trading-approvals). An allowance error
names one missing spender at a time. If it names the Neg Risk Adapter
(`0xd91E80cF2E7be2e162c6513ceD06f1dD0dA35296`), the account wallet is missing
the adapter approvals required for CTF negative-risk markets.

invalid.

    killed if no match is found.` — A Fill-and-Kill order found no matching orders
at all. At least one match is required.

**400** `Bad Request`

`the market is not yet ready to process new orders`

**500** `Internal Server Error`

`order timed out` — The exchange could not process the order before the
request deadline. This typically happens during bursts of concurrent order
submissions from the same account. The order was rejected before reaching the
order book and can be safely resubmitted.

***

## Matching Engine Errors

Internal matching engine errors that may surface during order execution.
