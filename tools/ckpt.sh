# ckpt.sh — THE FAST CHECKPOINT. Run after every meaningful edit, not just at
# the end of a task. Takes well under a second.
#
# WHY THIS IS UNGATED
# --------------------
# A session that can only checkpoint when everything is green cannot
# checkpoint at all while it is halfway through a multi-file change — and
# that is precisely when a usage cap tends to land. So ckpt.sh has NO gate:
# it commits whatever is on disk, red tests and all, and records honestly
# whether they passed. A broken intermediate state that is COMMITTED and
# DESCRIBED is recoverable; the same state uncommitted is not.
#
#   bash tools/ckpt.sh "what I just did" "what comes next"
#
# Both notes are written into CHECKPOINT.md and into the commit message, so a
# session resuming hours later reads one file and knows where it stands. The
# second argument is the important one: "what comes next" is the thing that
# is lost when a session dies, and it is the thing no diff can reconstruct.

# REPAIR THE AUTOMATIC SAFETY NET IF IT IS MISSING.
# The hooks only fire once they have been installed into the session root
# (see tools/install-hooks.sh — this container puts several repos side by
# side under one root, and Claude Code only reads hooks from that root, not
# from this repo's own .claude/settings.json), and that installation was a
# manual step a session could simply skip — in which case nothing was
# auto-saved for the WHOLE session and nothing said so. ckpt.sh is the one
# command CLAUDE.md tells every session to run constantly, so a session that
# reaches here gets the net back whether or not it read the instruction.
# Idempotent, silent when already correct.

# ---- test state, recorded rather than enforced ------------------------------
# Never gate on this. The point is to capture the state, whatever it is.
#
# DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED — a hard-coded list silently stops covering a suite
# added later. novig has no fixed stack yet, so this checks every shape a
# fast check could take rather than assuming one:
#   - tools/test_*.js / tools/test_*.sh / tools/test_*.py, whenever any land
#   - `npm test`, if package.json ever declares one
#   - `pytest`/unittest-style checks under tools/, covered by the glob above
# A slower full suite (a real device/emulator run, a Gradle build, whatever
# this project ends up needing) belongs in ship.sh, not here — a per-edit
# checkpoint needs "well under a second", not "however long a cold build
# takes".
