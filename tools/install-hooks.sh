#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-hooks.sh — put the checkpoint hooks where Claude Code will actually
# read them, WITHOUT destroying anything else that lives in that file, and
# WITHOUT ever touching a directory that isn't this repo.
#
# WHY THIS IS A MERGE, NOT A `cp`
# --------------------------------
# The naive version of this step is:
#
#     cp tools/session-root-hooks.json /home/user/.claude/settings.json
#
# That works, and it is also an unconditional overwrite of the one file a
# user's own Claude Code settings live in — permissions, env, statusLine,
# and hooks belonging to OTHER projects in the same container (this account
# runs at least two other repos, fantasy-football and Portfolio, side by
# side with this one). Every session that ran that `cp` would silently
# delete whatever those repos had written there. Nothing warns, because a
# clobbered settings file looks exactly like a settings file.
#
# So this merges instead: our hook entries are tagged with a marker, and
# only entries carrying that marker are ever touched. Everything else in the
# file — including any hooks a sibling repo installed for itself — is
# preserved byte-for-byte through a JSON round-trip.
#
# WHY EVERY INSTALLED COMMAND IS AN ABSOLUTE PATH INTO THIS REPO ONLY, NEVER
# A GLOB OVER SIBLING DIRECTORIES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An earlier design (ported more literally from Portfolio, which shares this
# checkpoint pattern across its own multi-repo container) had each hook glob
# every repo under the session root and run that repo's own
# resume.sh/autosave.sh in turn, aggregating all of them into one briefing.
# That is the wrong shape here: novig's working agreement is explicit that
# fantasy-football and Portfolio are READ ONLY for this project's work, and
# autosave.sh's whole job is `git add -A && git commit && git push` — running
# it inside either of those repos' real checkouts, even as a side effect of
# infrastructure built for THIS repo, would be exactly the kind of change to
# another repo this project must never make. So every command below points
# at this repo's own tools/ directory by absolute path and nothing else is
# ever touched, at the cost of not automatically re-protecting a sibling repo
# whose own hooks aren't firing. That trade is intentional.
#
# It is idempotent — running it when it is already current changes nothing
# and writes nothing — so it is safe to call from other tools (ckpt.sh and
# resume.sh both do, so a session that forgets to run this by hand still
# gets the safety net the moment it checkpoints or resumes).
#
#   bash tools/install-hooks.sh           # install or repair
#   bash tools/install-hooks.sh --check   # 0 = current, 1 = needs installing
#   bash tools/install-hooks.sh --quiet   # only speak if something changed

# WHERE DOES CLAUDE CODE READ HOOKS FROM HERE?
# NOT this repo's own .claude/settings.json, whenever this repo sits as a
# subdirectory of a session root that Claude Code resolves for hooks
# purposes (confirmed on this account's other repos, running in the same
# kind of container: Claude Code on the web, several repos under one root).
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is unset in that case and the harness resolves ONE
# project root for the session — which is the directory CONTAINING the
# repo. $HOME is a different thing entirely (the harness keeps its own
# hooks there), so do not use it.
#
# CLAUDE_HOOK_SETTINGS overrides the target and CLAUDE_REPO_ROOT overrides
# the root used to LOCATE it — tools/test_resume.sh sets both to temp paths
# so the tests can never touch the real settings file. Substitution of the
# placeholder in the template always uses THIS repo's own path ($D), never
# the container root — see the header above for why.
