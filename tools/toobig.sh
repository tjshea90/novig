# toobig.sh — fires when the conversation has grown enough to auto-compact.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Every turn resends the whole conversation, and prompt caching only makes
# that cheap while the cache is WARM. Come back to a big session hours later
# and the cache has expired: the entire conversation is re-read at full
# price before a single new word is written.
#
# Compaction is not the escape either. It REWRITES the earlier messages,
# which is itself a cold start on the rewritten portion, and it summarises
# away detail that CHECKPOINT.md holds losslessly on disk anyway.
#
# The cheap move is to stop and start a fresh session: tools/resume.sh
# rebuilds everything a session needs from GitHub in well under a hundred
# lines, versus re-reading a conversation that by this point is far larger
# than that.
#
# So: guarantee everything is saved, then say so plainly.
