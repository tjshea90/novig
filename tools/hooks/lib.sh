#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
# -----------------------
# Claude Code on the web can put several of this account's repos side by
# side under one session root (this container has, at minimum, novig,
# fantasy-football and Portfolio). Claude Code resolves ONE project root for
# hook purposes and does not load a hook from a repo's own .claude/settings.json
# when the repo is a subdirectory of that root — see tools/install-hooks.sh
# for how the hooks actually get installed. Because of that, whatever runs
# from the session root has to handle every repo present, not just this one.

# The container root. Every repo is a directory directly under it.
# Overridable so tools/test_resume.sh can point this at a fixture with two
# fake repos and actually prove the multi-repo case, rather than assuming it.

}

# Run "$1" (a path relative to each repo root) in every repo, in --text mode,
# and print the concatenation. $2 is the total time budget in seconds; it is
# SHARED between repos rather than per-repo, because the hook's own timeout
# is what actually gets enforced and blowing it loses everything, not just
# the slow repo. $3, if given, is fed to each script as stdin — resume,
# autosave and toobig need nothing from the event itself, so it is always
# empty for them; capture_inbox needs the raw UserPromptSubmit payload, so
# tools/hooks/inbox.sh passes it through here.
