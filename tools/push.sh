#
# WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE
# ------------------------
# Both ckpt.sh and autosave.sh need to answer "is there anything to push?"
# cheaply, because autosave runs after every single tool call and a no-op
# network round trip on each one is latency paid hundreds of times a session
# for nothing.
#
# The obvious test — `git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD` — has a failure mode
# worth guarding against. `@{u}` needs a remote-TRACKING ref
# (refs/remotes/origin/main). A checkout whose branch was created from
# FETCH_HEAD has branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge set, looks
# completely normal to `git remote show`, and still has no such ref — so
# `@{u}` errors, the `|| echo 0` fallback reads as "nothing to push", and the
# push is skipped in silence. The commit is made, the session reports
# success, and the work never leaves the container. On a usage cap that is
# total loss.
#
# So the rule here: when the count cannot be determined, PUSH. A wasted push
# costs a second; a skipped one can cost the whole session.

  # leaves no refspec, so `git fetch origin` only ever writes FETCH_HEAD and

  # KEEP main CURRENT, BEST-EFFORT. Claude Code on the web can assign a

  # "Branches" section for why that matters here. A session that only pushes
  # its own branch leaves the DEFAULT branch stale, and a future session (or
  # a different account working the same repo) that just opens the repo,
  # rather than rediscovering a specific branch name, lands on that stale
  # default and sees none of this work.
