#
# WHY THIS IS NOT ckpt.sh
# -----------------------
# ckpt.sh is the DELIBERATE checkpoint: it runs whatever tests exist, and it
# rewrites CHECKPOINT.md with "what I just did" and "what comes next" — the
# two things no diff can reconstruct. It needs a session that knows its own
# intent.
#
# This runs from a hook, after every file edit and every bash command, with
# no idea what the session is trying to do. So it does the opposite:
#   - no test run (it fires constantly; it must take milliseconds)
#   - it NEVER touches CHECKPOINT.md — overwriting a real "Do this next" with
#     an invented one would destroy the exact thing the next session needs
#   - no gate of any kind: a broken half-edit that is COMMITTED is
#     recoverable, the same half-edit uncommitted dies with the session
#
# It exists for one failure: the usage cap landing mid-change. Everything up
# to the last completed tool call is already on GitHub when that happens.
#
# ALWAYS exits 0. A checkpoint that breaks the session it is protecting is
# worse than no checkpoint.

# A STALE LOCK MUST NEVER WEDGE THE SAFETY NET.
# This hook has a timeout. If Claude Code kills it mid `git commit` (network
# hiccup, slow disk, whatever), git can leave a `*.lock` file behind — and
# every commit for the REST OF THE SESSION then fails silently until
# something removes it, which is exactly the "usage ran out and nothing
# after that point was saved" failure this file exists to prevent. A fresh
# container never inherits one from a past session (nothing here is tracked
# in git, so a clone can't carry it in) — this only guards against THIS
# session's own hook timing out. Anything older than the timeout is
# unambiguously dead, not just slow, so it's safe to clear.
