#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# A session can be killed by a usage cap at any point, with no warning. The
# next session — possibly a different account, a different device, hours or
# days later — opens this repo COLD: no memory of the conversation, no idea a
# previous session existed. Everything it needs has to already be on disk and
# has to arrive without Tj typing an explanation, because the whole point is
# that he does not have to remember one.
#
# So this prints the briefing into the new session's context automatically:
# where the last session stopped (CHECKPOINT.md), what the job is (TASKS.md),
# the raw inbox (INBOX.md's tail), the working agreement, and — the part
# bootstrap.sh cannot know — whether this checkout is actually current with
# GitHub, and whether the automatic checkpointing was still working when the
# last session died.
#
# BUDGET. Everything printed here is re-sent on every subsequent turn. Keep
# this short — narrative detail belongs in CHECKPOINT.md/TASKS.md/CLAUDE.md,
# not in growing this file.

# --text: print the briefing as plain text instead of wrapping it in JSON —
# a manual convenience for a human eyeballing it directly
# (`bash tools/resume.sh --text | less`), not something the hook path uses.

# SELF-REPAIR THE SAFETY NET.
# If this is running from the hook, the hooks are obviously already
# installed and this is a cheap no-op (install-hooks.sh's own --check-style
# comparison short-circuits). But CLAUDE.md also tells a session to run this
# BY HAND when the briefing did not appear — and that is exactly the case
# where the hooks are missing and every edit for the rest of the session
# would go unsaved. Idempotent and silent when already correct either way.
